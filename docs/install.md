Install
===

Installing this tool is fairly straightforward:

```
npm install
```

This should install the node packages needed to run this program.

The main binary is located in ```./bin/dimebox```.

> **Note:** In some systems (particularly some Blue Gene/Q systems), certificates may me be a tricky area. In this case, first set ```npm config set strict-ssl=false``` before installing.
